## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
- The game
- [BepInEx 5.4.23.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

### Steps
1. Install BepInEx into the game's root folder (where the .exe is located).
2. Launch the game once, then exit. This generates the BepInEx folder structure.
3. Place the `RealTimeWeatherMod.dll` file into `BepInEx/plugins/`.
4. Launch the game.
5. Edit the generated config file (see below). Press `F7` in-game to reload the config.

## ⚙️ Configuration

After the first run, a configuration file is generated here: `BepInEx/config/chillwithyou.envsync.cfg`

**Optional**: If you have [iGPU Savior](https://github.com/Small-tailqwq/iGPUSaviorMod) installed, 
some settings will also appear in the in-game MOD Settings tab for convenience.

### Weather API Providers
This fork supports both Seniverse and OpenWeather, but mainly made for OpenWeather. Select one using the `WeatherProvider` field.

| Provider | Location Format | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seniverse** | City name (e.g., `beijing`, `上海`) | Made for Chinese users, lower free tier quota. |
| **OpenWeather** | City name **or** `latitude,longitude` (e.g., `40.7128,-74.0060`) | Global; 60 calls per minute free tier. |

**Example Config Snippets**

*Using Seniverse:*
```ini
[WeatherAPI]
EnableWeatherSync = true
WeatherProvider = Seniverse
ApiKey = YOUR_SENIVERSE_KEY_HERE
# (There's a default Seniverse key already so don't worry.)
Location = beijing
```

*Using OpenWeather:*
```ini
[WeatherAPI]
EnableWeatherSync = true
WeatherProvider = OpenWeather
ApiKey = YOUR_OPENWEATHER_KEY_HERE
Location = 40.7128,-74.0060
# or use a city name:
# Location = New York City
```

*General Settings:*
```ini
[WeatherSync]
RefreshMinutes = 10

[Temperature]
TemperatureUnit = Celsius

[TimeConfig]
Sunrise = 06:30
Sunset = 18:30

[UI]
ShowWeatherOnDate = true

[Automation]
EnableSeasonalEasterEggs = true

[Unlock]
UnlockAllEnvironments = true
UnlockAllDecorations = true

[Debug]
EnableDebugMode = false
SimulatedCode = 13
SimulatedTemp = 13
SimulatedText = DebugWeather
```

### Obtaining an API Key
- **Seniverse:**
  1. Visit the [Seniverse Developer Platform](https://www.seniverse.com/).
  2. Register, log in, and go to `Console` -> `Product Management` -> `Free Edition` (or your subscription tier).
  3. Find the **Private Key** for the weather API product and copy it.
  4. Paste the key into the `ApiKey` field in the config file (no quotes needed).
  5. Set `WeatherProvider = Seniverse`.

> 💡 The newer version has a built-in key. You can leave the `ApiKey` field empty to use the default service, or use your own.
> 💡 The default key is only for Seniverse, if you require a global (OpenWeather) key, you'll have to get it yourself, but no worries, it's totally free.

- **OpenWeather:**
  1. Visit [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
  2. Go to your [API keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) section.
  3. Generate a new key or use the default one provided.
  4. Paste this key into both the `ApiKey` field and the `GeneralAPI` field in the config file.
  5. Set `WeatherProvider = OpenWeather`.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage (Enabled by Default)
The plugin automatically switches base environments based on your configured (or fetched) sunrise and sunset times:
- **Day**: From 1 hour after sunrise until 30 minutes before sunset.
- **Sunset/Twilight**: From 30 minutes before sunset until 30 minutes after sunset.
- **Night**: From 30 minutes after sunset until 1 hour after sunrise.

### Weather Sync Mode (Requires Manual Enable)
1. Configure your API Key and Location as described above.
2. Set `EnableWeatherSync = true`.
3. The plugin will fetch weather data at the interval set by `RefreshMinutes` (default: 10).

4. **Weather Severity Logic**:
   - **Normal Weather**: Day, Sunset, and Night switch as per the basic time cycle.
   - **Severe Weather** (e.g., heavy rain, thunderstorms, blizzards): During daytime and sunset periods, the environment is forced to **Cloudy**. The sunset effect is skipped. **Nighttime is never overridden by weather**.

5. **Precipitation Effect Logic** (based on internal weather code mapping):

| Effect | Internal Weather Codes (Seniverse) | Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ❄️ Snow | 20–25 | All snow types. |
| ⛈️ ThunderRain | 11, 12, 16–18 | Thunderstorms, heavy rainstorms. |
| 🌧️ HeavyRain | 10, 14, 15 | Showers, moderate to heavy rain. |
| 🌧️ LightRain | 13, 19 | Drizzle, light rain, freezing rain. |
| **Off** | 0–9, 26–39 | Clear, cloudy, foggy, windy (all precipitation effects are turned off). |

6. **OpenWeather ID Mapping**:

| OpenWeather Condition ID | Mapped Internal Code | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 800 | 0 | Clear |
| 801–804 | 4–9 | Cloudy |
| 200–232 | 11 | ThunderRain |
| 300–399, 500–501 | 13 | LightRain |
| 502–504, 520–531 | 10, 14 | HeavyRain |
| 600–622 | 22–25 | Snow |
| 701–781 | 26 | Foggy |

### Hotkey Functions

- **F7 – Force Refresh Weather**
  - **Purpose**: Immediately fetches the latest weather data from the API, ignoring the cache and resetting the refresh timer.
  - **Use when**: The weather has changed outside but the game hasn't updated yet, or after changing the `Location` in the config.

- **F8 – Show Status**
  - **Purpose**: Prints the current plugin state, active environment, and UI weather string to the BepInEx log.

- **F9 – Force Environment Re-application**
  - **Purpose**: Uses the currently cached weather data and local time to forcefully re-calculate and apply the game environment, bypassing any "already active" checks.
  - **Use when**: The game's visual/audio state seems out of sync with the UI, or to test time-based transitions without waiting.

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Framework**: BepInEx 5.x
- **Target Framework**: .NET Framework 4.7.2
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Harmony patches (for game function injection)
  - Unity coroutines (for asynchronous network requests)
  - Reflection (to access internal game systems)

### v5.0.1
- Internal refactoring. Added missing scenery type enumerations.

### v5.0.0
- Major refactor: Introduced the `SceneryAutomationSystem` as a separate `MonoBehaviour` component to handle seasonal easter eggs and automatic scenery/sound triggers without interfering with core weather sync logic.
- Rule-based system: Scenery rules (e.g., fireworks for Lunar New Year, cooking sounds at meal times) are now defined as configurable `SceneryRule` objects.
- User interaction tracking: If a user manually toggles a scenery element, the system will stop auto-managing it for the rest of the session.

### v4.5.0

- Added config option `ShowWeatherOnDate` to control this feature.
- Requires `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll` reference.

### v4.4.1
- Refined "bad weather" logic. Light rain, snow showers, and intermittent precipitation are no longer considered severe weather that forces a cloudy daytime.

### v4.4.0
- Reworked environment derivation logic. Nighttime is now always preserved as night, regardless of weather conditions.

### v4.3.1 / v4.3.0
- Fixed an issue where pressing `F9` while the Cloudy environment was active could incorrectly close all other environments.

### v4.2.x Series
- Various fixes and adjustments to hotkey logic and logging.
- Added a debug mode for testing weather code mappings.

### v3.7.0 – v4.1.0
- Optimized `F9` key logic and log messages.
- Fixed occasional log deadlocks.
- Corrected sunset transition timing from 1 hour to the intended 30 minutes.
- Implemented caching logic:
  - **Fast Clock (30 sec)**: Uses cached weather data to check for time-based transitions. No network call.
  - **Slow Clock (User-defined, default 30 min)**: Forces a new API call to refresh weather data, regardless of cache state.

*(For detailed history, check the Git commit log.)*

## 🐛 Known Issues

- First load may take ~15 seconds before the initial environment sync occurs.
- Some weather effects may incorrectly trigger the user interaction log message `[User Interaction] User took over [HeavyRain], stopping auto-management.` This does not affect the actual switching logic.
- Game crashing when tabbing in and out of the game window
